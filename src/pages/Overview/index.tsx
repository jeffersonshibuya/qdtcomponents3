                This solution takes Adobe PDF files provided by the State of
                Georgia for Election Updates and 2016 WSB-TV Atlanta election
                Data to provide Georgia 2016 vs. 2020 voting comparisons. IPC
                Global transforms the data daily to enable quick real-time
                analysis and news segments. Census Bureau
                (census.georgia.gov/census-data) is used to source race, age,
                and ethnicity by county to understand the County numbers. Census
                Bureau information is currently based on 2019 data available, so
                that the number may have slightly changed.
